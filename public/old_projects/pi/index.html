		<p>This website cycles throught the first million digits of pi, which were accessed from <a href='https://www.angio.net/pi/digits/pi1000000.txt'>here</a>, every 24 hours. It starts at 12:00 AM every day.<br> This was mainly inspired by pi videos such as Numberphile's <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r3cEKZiLmg'>Mile of Pi</a>, and other interesting websites about pi such as the <a href='https://www.angio.net/pi/'>Pi-Search Page</a> by Dave Andersen</p>
		<p>Currently, I am working on implementing a feature that shows when points of interest will appear in pi, such as the Feynman point and the world record for memorization. I am also working on controls to go to a specific time, cycle through digits manually, and find other ways to explore pi. I also want to work on performance and maybe use more server-size stuff rather than downloading a 1mb text file when the page loads.
